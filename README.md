# 06-weather-app
In this assignment I was asked to create a weather app using the openweathermap api that was display the current weather of the city that was searched for, including the humidity, wind speed, date, and UV Index. Along with this I was asked to display a 5-day forecast for the city selected. All previous cities are listed and can be re-selected to display the appropriate information
